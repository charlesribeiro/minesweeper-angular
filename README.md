# Minesweeper

This is a browser implementation of the classic game Minesweeper using Angular.

This project uses Jest for unit testing.


## TL;DR

Make sure you have NPM and Yarn installed on your machine, install dependencies with `yarn`. Then, just run `yarn start` to open the project. `yarn test` and `yarn test-coverage` will run the Jest unit tests.
