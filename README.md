# Minesweeper

This is a browser implementation of the classic game Minesweeper using Angular 16.

## Tecnnologies used

* Angular 16
* TailwindCSS with SASS
* Redux (NgRx + RxJs)
* Jest (jest-preset-angular)

## TL;DR

Make sure you have NPM and Yarn installed on your machine, install dependencies with `yarn`. Then, just run `yarn start` to open the project. `yarn test` and `yarn test-coverage` will run the Jest unit tests.
